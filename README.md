A collection of my dotfiles

1. Run `apt-install.sh` to install all packages written in `apt-packages.txt`
2. Move config files by executing `deploy.sh`
3. Initialize tools with `initialize.sh`

You can run `git pull && bash ./deploy.sh` to apply changes.  
`initialize.sh` should be executed only for the first setup.
